He nimbly weaves through the legs of his shipmates, constantly rearranging scroll cases and satchels swinging from his diminutive frame. Jewlery of disparate cultures adorns seemingly every visible part of his body.  Vrixx wears wispy chops on his nodule-crusted cheeks.  He sometimes braids them, claiming he learned it from a Dwarven prince.  Vrixx has shown himself to be a crack shot with his crossbow.</p><p>Vrixx was born to a small tribe deep in the underdark. He often found himself skulking about the surrounding caverns. Vrixx found he could learn much by being silent.  While many Knucklechewers were content to merely raid and pillage, Vrixx found himself possessed of another trait rather unique to a Goblin - curiosity. During one such raid, he came across a map. His excitment only grew when he recognized the landmarks and a path to a ruin near the surface. He met actual surfacers there, also drawn to the ruins. Emboldened by not being killed on sight, Vrixx returned to the surface with them.</p><p>Vrixx had many adventures uncovering lost sites and the treasures contained within. He also gained a reputation as a peerless cartographer. It was for this talent the captain of the Dragon's Demise sought him out. Vrixx leapt at the opportunity to sail to parts unknown and add to his collection of maps. He's always happy to share one and show off one of his many ancient trinkets.</p>",

        html:"<p>Gomez never quite fit in at the academy of learning his wealthy parents had sent him too. He spent most of the time gazing off into the sky. Both day and night he was fascinated by weather and the stars. In fact, geography and astronomy were the only classes he ever really paid attention to. His father, a wealthy banker, knew Gomez would never be able to handle the bank on his own and instead planned to leave the business to Gomez's youger brother Phillip.</p><p>Nevertheless, Gomez seemed to have an uncanny knack for predicting which farmers would have a boom or bust year. His father would take his advice to make loans based on what crops the farmers said they were planning to grow. Somehow Gomez just knew whether there'd be enough rain to grow rice, or whether the farmers ought to be planting another, more drought resistant crop. Gomez also predicted the sea rise that leveled the farms of one of the Arendales, one of the regions most wealthy families who had been furious when Gomez's father had refused to loan them money to plant additional acreage. When asked how he knew those things would happen, Gomez just smiled and said it was a lucky guess, but the truth was that he'd been devouring every book he could get his hands on that discussed weather, the tides, planetary movements, or geology. He also had a keen set of eyes and could spot a storm a long way off. When he was 12, his father had gifted him a glass, in a tube of sorts, that allowed him to see things that were far off as if they were quite close. It was his most prized possession and he's never let anyone look through it, other than the captain who had saved his life once.</p><p>Gomez was and always had been fascinated by storms, and as such he'd been trying to learn a bit more about what caused the loud, booming noise that seemed to be correlated with the lightning he'd seen. In fact, he'd rigged up a small tower to try and attract some lightning a bit more closely, so that he could confirm that the closer the lightning seemed, the louder and and more quickly he would hear the corresponding boom. Gomez had covered the peak of his tower with pieces of iron that he'd been able to collect. He was standing on that tower when the storm began and the Dragon's Demise put into the harbor seeking shelter. The captain spotted the young man there, and knew from his time at sea, that standing in the highest place you can reach in the middle of a lightning storm was a foolhardy thing to do. He yelled up to the young man and convinced him to come down only minutes before lighting struck the tower directly and left little more than a smouldering ruin. Gomez was grateful and interested in how the captain had known so much about lighting. The captain was interested when Gomez told him that it would rain for 4 days straight, but afterwards there would be two days with no winds.......and that is exactly what occurred.</p><p>Gomez also related to his father what had transpired and his father agreed to help finance some of the Dragon's Demise's renovations and upgrades. While they were occurring, Gomez became fast friends with the captain, and eventually asked if he could become part of the crew. His father thought it might help keep an eye on his investment, and Gomez was happy to have a new vantage from which to study the stars and the weather. Now, Gomez helps with the accounting and bookkeeping on the ship. He's also typically consulted about how the weather will fare over the next few days or weeks before the ship makes way and has proven remarkably accurate. Beyond that, he likes to climb to the crow's nest and spot things, and that is where he'd prefer to spend most of his time, though the map room and the navigational charts are also of great interest to him.</p>",

One drunken night Karma got into a bar fight with Capital marines. They beat him to a pulp - Karma tried to save him but his father died from the wounds. After Karma's father died the only thing of value was the sword. Karma intended to sell the sword to be able to afford his father's funeral, but when he grabbed it he heard voices.</p><p>Not seeing where they came from, he slowly learned that it was the sword. All that carried this sword's voices are in this sword. Some were great legends; they were able to tell Karma where their riches were. He sought them out but they were long since plundered.</p><p>Karma decided to tell the tale of those great legends that have died many years ago. He ended up on the Dragon Demise when the captain heard his stories.  The captain invited him along to make some stories of his own.

He often has difficulty with the cramped quarters of most seafaring ships, but that doesn’t keep him from his one true love, the ocean.  He actually grew up in the mountains, but sought adventure at an early age.  He headed to the shore when he was sixteen and signed on with a privateer’s ship (The Doubtful) as a deck hand.  He saw plenty of action and the captain of that ship, Mister Frederick Abernathy of South Shore, prized him for his immense strength and prowess with the cutlass.  After two years of faithful service with Abernathy, he was rewarded with a beautiful cutlass he named Heartbreaker, which coincidentally was the nickname Aladdin had earned among his fellow sailors, for the way he always seemed to have a lass take a fancy with him in every port.</p><p>Eventually Aladdin fell victim to his own ways, as he fell in love with a half giantess named Lil that he met while on shore leave in the Dusky Bay.  She stole his heart, and he gave her six children over the coming years.  He’d disembark at Dusky Bay, and stay on shore for months at a time, working as a longshoreman.  Still, the draw of the sea would always call to him and eventually he’d sign on with whatever privateer happened through Dusky Bay.  Once on the open ocean, he’d return to his old ways.  After ten years, Lil discovered that she wasn’t the only apple in Aladdin’s eye, and cast him out in a frightful row that woke the town.  Since then, Aladdin has sworn off women, though he still wears a silver locket with a drawing of Lil around his neck.</p><p>Aladdin is frightful with his cutlass and a dead eye shot with the thrown dagger.  He’s an immense figure and is always the first to swing across to an enemy ship, howling as he swings, striking fear into the hearts of all who oppose him.</p>",

She’s heard rumors that he still sails on a ship out on the isles; the Magical Leopleurodyn. She asks after him at every port.

It had such a nice ring to its name. She just knew it was the boat for her.</p><p>And it gave her a way to look for her father.  She’s a crew member but works her whiles and tricks when in port and though there are few lasses on the boat, the men say she severed the cock of one of the mates with her teeth when he’d tried to forcefully mount her. He’s no longer sailing with the crew and the rest of the mates leave her to herself now, though she can climb the rigging and 'man' a ballista fairly well.

It was upon that fateful day Fiske woke up in the town of Luskan with a cracked skull and no idea how he'd gotten there.  The barkeep knew the fragments Fiske now repeats when asked: Fiske had arrived on a ship the night before, said it was his birthday, and tried to fight the entire tavern.  The blow to his head was from the bosun of the Dragon's Demise.  Fiske sought out the ship to finish what he'd apparently started.  He has the vague impression he's always let his temper get the best of him.  Upon arriving to the ship, the bosun refused the fight.  Instead, she convinced him to sign up.  Realizing he apparently had nothing better to do, he signed on that day.</p><p>Fiske fights with his fists just as often as his axe.  He particularly enjoys using anything he can find to cause carnage on his enemies.  When asked why he doesn't draw his axe, Fiske is quick to reply, 'What's the fun in an axe when the world is my weapon!?'  The crew has had many a laugh watching him tear apart an enemy ship from underneath him and use its pieces to fight.  His favorite story to recount is the time he threw Karma blade-first in to a pirate.  Karma seems less than impressed each time Fiske tells it, but Fiske roars with laughter anyway.  He is generally rather congenial, but with a razor-thin temper that can send him flying headlong at even his crewmates from time to time.  Some of the crew have ongoing bets on who he'll pummel next.</p>",
